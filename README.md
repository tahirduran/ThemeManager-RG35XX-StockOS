# ThemeManager for RG35XX Stock OS

The latest version of the RG35XX stock OS offers stability and performance that surpasses many custom OS options. However, its interface design leaves much to be desired.

ThemeManager is here to change that. This application allows you to easily manage and apply different themes, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of your RG35XX device.
